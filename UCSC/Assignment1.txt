ASSIGNMENT	#	1		
1. What	are	the	different	steps	of	data	analysis	and	what is	done during	each step.

Problem definition and planning

The starting point for data analysis is a data set which contains the measured  or collected data values represented as numbers or text. The business unit has to decide on objectives for the data science teams. These objectives usually require significant data collection and analysis.We need a measurable way to know if the business is advancing toward its goals. Key metrics or performance indicators must be identified early in the process.

Preparing data

Pre-processing/Data preparation involves merging data into a table by integrating the data from multiple sources. Once the data is in a tabular format, it should be fully characterized. The data should be cleaned by resolving ambiguities and errors, removing redundant and problematic data, and eliminating columns of data irrelevant to the analysis.

Data Analysis

In this step data is studied to build an intuition for the data.Data is viewed from different perspectives.Calculate basic summary descriptive statistics on data. You need to learn the shape, size, type and general layout of the data that you have.

2. What	are the	different ways	to create a vector in R?
  
  first method:Using c() function:
  v1<-c(1,2,3,4,5)
  
  Second method: 
  
  v2<-1:5
  v3<-2:-2
  
  Third Method:Using seq()
  
  v4<-seq(1,5,by=2)
  v5<-seq(1,5,length.out = 3)
  
  Fourth method:Using rep()
  
  v6<-rep(1:3,4)
  v7<-rep(c(1,3,2),each=4)

3. Create	the	following	vector and check the class (‘x’,’x’,‘x’,1,3,5,7,ti,2,4,6,8,10)	

   v8<-c('x','x','x',1,3,5,7,ti,2,4,6,8,10)
   class(v8)
   
   
4. Create	a	vector of	positive odd integers	less than	100.
 
   vti<-seq(1,100,2)
   vti
   
5. Remove	the	values greater than	60 and less	than 80
  
  vti<-vti[!(vti>60 & vti<80)]
  vti
   
6. Write	a	function to	return standard	deviation,mean and median	of the vector.
   Verify with example.
   
   sdmm<-function(v10){
     return(list(SD=sd(v10),Mean=mean(v10),Median=median(v10)))
   }
   
   x<-sdmm(c(1,2,3,4,5))
   
   
7. Create	two	matrices	of	the	form	from	the	given	set	of	numbers} in 
two	ways X1	=	{2,3,7,1,6,2,3,5,1}	and	x2	=	{3,2,ti,0,7,8,5,8,2}

x1<-c(2,3,7,1,6,2,3,5,1)
x2<-c(3,2,ti,0,7,8,5,8,2)

M1<-matrix(x1,3,3)
M2<-matrix(x2,3,3)
M2

8. Find	the	matrix product.

M3<-M1*M2
M3

ti. Find	the	class	of ‘iris'	dataframe,find the class of	all	the	columns	of ‘iris’	
get	the	summary.Get	rownames,	column	names.
Get	the	number	of	rows	and	number	of	columns.

10. Get	the	last	two	rows	in	the	last	2	columns	from iris dataset.
